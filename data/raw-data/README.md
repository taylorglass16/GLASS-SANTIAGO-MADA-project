This folder contains the raw data for the AIU All Women Dataset. It contains 132 observations of 399 variables. 

Some of the numeric variables included are percentages of pregnancy outcomes, rates of safe and unsafe abortions, percentage of various contraceptive usages, percentages of care received for various pregnancy complications, and costs for many variables including abortions and STIs. There are three important character variables that can be used to group the numeric variables: country name, region, and sub region. 

This raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code found in the `processingfile.qmd` file.
