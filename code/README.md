This folder contains three sub-folders for each section of code: processing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis. 

Begin with opening the processing-code folder to find the processing-file.qmd file to process the raw data. 

Proceed to the eda-code folder to find the eda.qmd file to load the processed data and create exploratory figures. 

Finish with the analysis-code folder to find the statistical-analysis.qmd file to create and test models for the data.
