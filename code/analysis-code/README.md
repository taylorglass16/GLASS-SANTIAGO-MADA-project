This folder contains code to do the full statistical analysis on the processed and explored data. This code creates simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models with various combinations of predictors. Performance metrics are included to determine which model performs best. 

Further model exploration is done through cross-validation, bootstrapping, LASSO regression, random forest modeling, and parameter tuning. 

All results from this file are saved in the results > figures > final-figures folder.
