This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data.

The code produces many tables and figures, which are saved in the results > figures > exploratory-figures folder.

This EDA focuses on the percentage of pregnancies among those using SARCs and the 7 main predictors we plan to use to model this outcome. 

The `eda.html` file is a rendered version of the `eda.qmd` file, which contains all of the same information. 

The `eda_files` folders contains extra information from rendering the project. This information can be ignored since it is just used to generate the final product and does not provide any extra insight.
